Create default tools/frameworks for processing/importing public datasets into Graph DBs.
Target is to build import process using GraphML for db independence.
Initial implementation to target Neo4J.

Expect various projects that will use this, initial proof of concept
will utilize  myexperiments.org public dataset, follow project giVe_myexperiments


Activity
07/13/2013 - Implement generalized flow framework similar to PIPE abstraction on top of akka actor
				This will allow generalized construction of various tasks that are to be performed when crawling and extracting public datasets for import to neo4j
